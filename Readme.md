# CO2 Bird 

This code is for configuring a CO2 sensor with an ESP8266 either via use of ESPHome ([esphome.io](https://esphome.io/)) or by directly flashing code on the device.

## ESPHome

Use the yaml to setup the device

## Standalone
Flash the sketch in the `code` folder.

Before doing so add the [SparkFun SCD4x CO2 Sensor Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SCD4x_Arduino_Library) into the same folder.
